                    <h3> Fix Naked Edge of a Mesh </h3>
                    <p>
                        I downloaded the smiley minion file from Thingiverse. The original file has two separated parts, the front and back of the minion. 
                        
                    </p>
                    <a class="download" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:179106" download>Smily Minion Original STL</a>

                   <p>First, I needed to clean the mesh before merging them. I noticed the 2 meshes were closed mesh, however, when run Mesh Repair, it says it's bad mesh. 
                       I hit repair button, and also cicked around some other controls. I end up break the mesh and caused 1 naked edge occured.  </p>

                    <p>I then messed around for a very long time but couldn't fix it effectively, SOS Junchao and he troubleshoot with me and we tried different methods to finally fixed it. Below are the steps we took. </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Use command + sift to select around the broken surface and delete the broken meshes</li>
                        <li>Export the object so that all the surfaces are broken into separate pieces</li>
                        <li>Select the broken piece and use invert command to insert select all the other pieces</li>
                        <li>Hide the selected good pieces</li>
                        <li>Use polyline to connect the mesh points (turn on Vertex, it helps to get the cross snap to the exact mesh point)</li>
                        <li>Select two meshline and user the command loft to create a surface</li>
                        <li>If step 7 didn't work as expected, convert mesh into Nurb (MeshtoNurb) then repeat step 7. (This helped to fix the less complex mesh lines where you can see the limited lines pretty clearly.)</li>
                        <li>To fix the more complex mesh lines where there are so many lines that looks overlapping. Use "Cap" to cap all empty surfaces</li>
                        <li>Then convert the Nurb back to mesh, and you can adjust how many surface you want to have.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Causion! ‚ö†Ô∏è Convert Mesh to Nurb might crash your computer.</p>

                    <h3> Merge Closed Mesh </h3>
                    <p>
                        I thought it would merge nicely given the two mesh are closed. But I ran into two issues. 
                    </p>

                    <p > First Attempt: I put the minion right next to each other with no overlap, after used the MeshBooleanUnion. The front and back can still be separated.</p>

                    <p>Second Sttempt: I overlap the front and back for about 1mm, then used MeshBooleanUnion. It turned into a crazy monster.</p>

                    <div class="assemble-img">
                        <div class="image-container">

                    <p>Third Sttempt: I decided to just put the two parts super close together and export as a single stl file, and imported to CURA. 
                        The thought is that they will get printed together, since the two objects are so close togehter it might get printed as one. 
                        It totally looks like a single piece after sliced it in CURA </p>

                    <p>
                       The plan is to make a square desk lamp that has objects inside, and when the light is on, the object inside will reveal. 
                       Some other ideas are add some fancy hollow shapes on the outside so it can show some interesting patters on the wall when the light is on. 
                    </p>

                    <h3> Test Print the Base</h3>
                    <p>The concept of the box is that the top can be removed and it will sit on the base. There is a wall on the base to help keep the top in place once it's on.
                        I modeled a 20mm small one to want to test the concept first. 
                    </p>

                    <p>The issue I ran into is not surprising. The top coulden't fit into the bottom. I will need to make some adjustments on the size in the next round. 
                        To make the inner width of the top square bigger or make the bottom wall smaller.

                    <h3> Test Print the Heart</h3>
                    <p>I found a solid heart STL on Thingiverse, and decided to do a test print. Given it's a heart shape, I was trying to see how to best place it on the bed. 
                        For this first attemp, I placed it vertically straignt to minimize the supporting materials. If I place it sideways, I was thinking it will be a mass to try to clean the supports.
                        I also didnt put add addiitonal support, and it got detached from the bed when it's less then half way done. 
                        The heart was been dragging back and forth on the board while the printer continued to print spaghetti üòÇ. 
                    </p>
                    <p>For the next trial, I will add brim or maybe some support to the base to help it stick better. </p>
