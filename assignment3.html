                    <h3> Bookmark Clips </h3>
                    <p>
                        I coulden't find any cardboards, so I decided to make some useful clips for what my housemates and I can use at home. 
                        The first type is a small bookmark clip. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I combined all the leaf and the clip in Grasshopper and printed as 1 object. The issue I ran into is that the gap of the clip 
                        is somewhat closed, but because the gap is set to be small, I was able to easily cut out the supports to open up the gap. 

                    </p>

                    <h3> Snack Clips </h3>
                    <p>
                        We have lots of snacks at home and we always struggle with not have enough clips to keep them fresh, so I made different variety of the clips. 

                    </p>

                            <p>
                                This one used the technique of printing the leaf and the clip separately.  
                                The back of the leave is indented with a rectangle polysurface. 
                                The front of the clip is portruding with the same size rectangle polysurface. I tried different ways to make this assemble piece. 
                    
                            </p>

                        
                            <ul>
                                <li>Have the indentation on the clip instead of the flower as I thought that might make the quality comes out better without having the portruding piece. </li>
                                <li>Tried different rotation of the clip to sit on the bed to reach optimal results. </li>
                                <li>Adjusted the tolerance of the clip and the leaf to make them better assemble together. </li>
                            
                            </ul>

                            <p> I reversed this version by indented the four leaf clover pattern on the clip instead.  </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Indented the leaf on the clip instead to see if the result is better. </li>
                                <li>This also safes time as the big leaf version was pretty but very time consuming. </li>

                    <p>
                        I made a difference size of the clip use to make a clipboard. This time, I learned from the previous lessons, I placed the clip side ways,
                        so that the gap is not overhanging this time and it came out nicely.

                    <p>
                       This took me forever, I tried many different ways to do things in grasshopper as much as possible, but failed again and again to reach the ideal result. 
                       The final result here is not super idea either, but it's definitely getting closed, and my conclusion is some of the work is just bettern done in Rhino. 
                       I end up deleted lots of my grasshopper code and new grasshopper functions I was trying out since I was not able to make it work.    
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I used grasshopper for all the offset work, then baked the spheres I needed and cut them in Rhino.     
                     </p>

                    <div class="three-columns-content-group">

                            <p>
                                I set up all the spheres needed, used offset surface, and built the rectangle in grasshopper as well and was able to cut it nicely, until, I realize the final object is all solid. 
                    
                            </p>

                            <p> Attemp 2 + more </p>

                            <p> I tried to draw a hollow sphere in grasshopper, wathed all the tutorials I could find online. First I was struggling with the "Loft" function as I was not able to connect two curves togehter. 
                                (The trick is to "hold" shift" to add another curve, I learned that after hours later from TA"). But even after that, I still run into other issues when try to complete the whole thing in grasshopper.
                                I reached to the point that I have to move on.   
                            </p>

                            <p> I end up still using the solid sphere, but did all the surface offset in Grasshopper and then bake them, and cut then in Rhino. 
                                I printed twice to try to get better results.
