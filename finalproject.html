                <div class="content">
                    <h3>Background </h3>
                    <p>
                       I have a bunch of jewelry that I have been strugging to find a way to better organize them.
                       There are lots of jewelry organizer you can buy online, but they are either not exactly the type I want. (e.g., have all the spots for all types of jewelry I have),
                       or the ones I like are too expensive and I couldn't justify the cost. 
                       So I have been just keeping all of them in a bag, which is not ideal. 
                       
                    </p>

                    <h3>Problems:</h3>

                    <ol>
                        <li>My necklaces always tangle together when kept all in one bag.</li>
                        <li>To avoide things tangle together, I sometimes don't want to put them back in the bag after finish using it. This cause me not able to find my jewelries when next time want to use them.  </li>
                        <li> Putting them all separated in different bags is troublesome, so I end up not Putting them back in the bag again. </li>


                    </ol>

                    <h3> Requirements:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>An organizer that has a custom spot for all different type of jewelries I have. </li>
                        <li>It can be moved around easily.</li>
                        <li>It will stay in place and can stand on it's own. </li>
                        <li>It's easy for user to take and put jewelries back.</li>
                        <li>Make ring slots using silicon.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Stretch Goals:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        
                        <li>Add a movable cap for the jewelry organizer so that you can close the cap and travel with it.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Has a hidden spot that allows the cap to be attach to the main organizer body. </li>
                            <li>Cap should be easily removed and attached to the organizer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>The cap should be able to close the whole box tight enough on it's own.  </li>
                    </ol>
