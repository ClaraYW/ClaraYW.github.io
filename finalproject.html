                    <h3>Background </h3>
                    <p>
                       I have a bunch of jewelry that I have been strugging to find a way to better organize them.
                       There are lots of jewelry organizer you can buy online, but they are either not exactly the type I want. (e.g., have all the spots for all types of jewelry I have),
                       or the ones I like are too expensive and I couldn't justify the cost. 
                       So I have been just keeping all of them in a bag, which is not ideal. 
                       
                    </p>

                    <h3>Problems:</h3>

                    <ol>
                        <li>My necklaces always tangle together when kept all in one bag.</li>
                        <li>To avoide things tangle together, I sometimes don't want to put them back in the bag after finish using it. This cause me not able to find my jewelries when next time want to use them.  </li>
                        <li> Putting them all separated in different bags is troublesome, so I end up not Putting them back in the bag again. </li>


                    </ol>

                    <h3> Requirements:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>An organizer that has a custom spot for all different type of jewelries I have. </li>
                        <li>I can move it around easily.</li>
                        <li>It will stay in place when I put them in a location. </li>
                        <li>It's easy for me to take and put my jewelries back.</li>

                    </ol>

                        <li>Measure and determine the size of the jewelry organizer I want, every piece also needs to be be within the constrain of the printer.</li>
                        <li>Grasshopper: Draw shapes that requires size adjustments using Grasshopper. (e.g.,like the size of the ring holder, bracelet holder, etc.)  </li>
                        <li>Rhino: Draw the main container, combine the different jewerly holder polysurfaces, produce the render view, export STL file(s) in Rhino. </li>
                        <li>Cura: Slice objects in Cura. (I might need to break it into few pieces and find ways to connect them later) </li>
                        <li>3d Printing: Print the object(s) using ender 3 pro.</li>
