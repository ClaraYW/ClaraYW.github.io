                    <h3> Adjustment to the Rhino model </h3>
                    <p>
                        I adjusted the pouring hold position per Professor Nadya's suggestions:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Attach the side half of the cone to the base of each half of the mold of mold.</li>
                        <li>Move the top half of the cone so that the bigger hole of the cone is connected with the wall of the mold of the mold.  </li>
                        <li>Moved the cone to the bottom of the hear shape instead of between the two humps. </li>
                        <li>Scaled up the two models.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        It took some time to get the half cone attached to the square mode and make the entire object a closed polysurface. I was able to figure it out in the end using the following metnods:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Position the half extruded cone correctly overlap with the heart and outside wall.</li>
                        <li>BooleanUnion the cone and the square.</li>
                        <li>Explode the unified object.</li>
                        <li>Select unwanted surfaces. (i.e., the other half of the cone that sticks out of the square wall. 
                            Since I turned it into a hollow cone previously, I also had to delete the extra surfaces inside the cone.</li>
                        <li>Select surface edge of the surfaces that has a gap and you can see the inside part of the object and untrim these surfaces, so that all sides of the square walls are closed. </li>
                        <li>Join all the surfaces together. (Make sure to select everything, I missed some surfaces when I first joined and was not able to join the already closed polysurface with the left out surfaces. </Li>
                        <li>Check that the entire object is a closed polysurface</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Making Headshape Plaster using Silicon Molds.</h3>
                    <p>Challenge: Find the right mix of plaster vs water was challenging because:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If the mixed liquid is too thick, it's hard to pour it into the silicon mold as the mold has a relative small hold.</li>
                        <li>If the mixed liquid is too watery, it's easy to pour, but after a period of time, the water start to separate from the mix. This led to the mold wasn't fully filled up.</li>
                        <li>The mixed liquid dried out pretty fast, I was struggling to get all of them inside the mold before it starts to get thick. </li>
                    </ol>

                    <H4>Attempt #1:</H4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Internet said 3:1 ratio for plaster and water, so I followed that initially </li>
                        <li>Then I realize it was quite watery, didn't turned out to look like how the tutorial showed, so I added more plaster.</li>
                        <li>I tried to pour the mixed plaster and water into the origianl pouring hole, and it was challenging.</li>
                        <li>I then tried to cut the outside silicon to make a bigger outside hole to better guide the liquid in through the cone.</li>
                        <li>I had to keep pressing the sides to get the air bubble out. I was surprise how the air bubble got in.</li>
                        <li>It took forever to fill it up, and the plater mix is drying out.</li>
                        <li>I tried to fill in as much as possible, but it was hard to tell if it's close to full or not, it is certainly getting heavier.</li>
                
                    </ol>
                    <p>It turns out that I didn't fill in enough plaster, but good thing is the finished part didn't look too bad when I took it out, and it filled the two humps pretty well. </p>

                    <p>Reflection: Later, I realize I might not need to abandan this model as the extra sample left in the cup did dried out even though initially it also had water separation issue.</p>


                    <h4>Attempt #3:</h4>
                    
                    <p>The only thing I adjusted this time is the plaster and water ratio. 
                        I went of the measure and just use the texture to judge if I had the right amount of plaster and water.
                        It was still challenging to fill it all in.</p>
                        
                    
                    
                    <p>Result: I filled it until I couldn't see a black hole anymore, but this model also field. 😔</p>

                    <p>I adjusted the pouring hole to be bigger and keep my plaster water ratio. </p>
                        
                    
                    
                    <p>Result: I wated for 24 hours this time and it turned out good! The bottom of the heart where it connects to the pouring hole is not perfect but can be fixed using knifes and sandpaper.</p>
