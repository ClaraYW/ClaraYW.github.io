                    <h3> Printer Assembling Check</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was lucky that my friend lended me a 3D printer. It is Creality Ender 3 Pro. Since the printer was already assemblied. I decided to still watch the assembling video to understand what are the part of a 3D printer. My other main task here is to check against the "gotchas" checklist to make sure things were set up correctly.

                    <p>
                        It took about 2.5 hours to get the level right including watching different tutorials, test with paper, make adjustments and test with test print models. When I tested with paper, 
                        I origianlly adjust the distance between the nozzel and the bed so that a sticky note can move freely with slight resistence. However, through one of the paper testing, I noticed the center of the bed is a bit dented. 
                        With the test print, as showen in below images, it had adhesion issues, so I had to tighend it up a few times to address that.I was worry about the nozzel was too close to the bed, as this the final trial, the paper cannot move around freely between the nozzel and the bed unless I use two hands to pull and push, byt it turns out that distance was close to perfect as shown in the final testing. 
                    </p>

                        I tried different build plate adhesion, skirt, brim and none. Brim did the best job to help making the bottom of the object looks nice as it helped to make sure the melted plastic sticks well each layer as the nozzel goes up. 
                        I also adjusted the initial layer print speed to 10mm/s to help with adhesion issues.

                    <p>
                        In rhino, I modeled two 3 square cm tubes, one with a wall of 0.8mm thick, the other with a wall of 1.6mm thick. I then sliced them in Cura4.8 with different settings and printed with Ender 3 pro and measured each cube with clipers. 
                        I originally thought I could adjust the wall thickness in Cura by changing the wall line count. After printed out with the different wall line count setting,  I noticed there weren't much difference between the size, it certainly wasn't double. 
                        Junchao helped to explained to me that the wall line count in Cura is auto calcualted based on the desired total thickness of the object, it's not going to double the thickness of the tube. I then made another model in Rhino, offset the surface with twice of the value, and printed the version two.

                    <ul>
                        <li> Increasing the tolerance level can create plat surface to a supposed to be rounded surface. </li>
                        <li> You can define the Z-steam alignment either use the shortest line or random or define a specific posiiton.</li>
                        <li> Infill Density impacts the speed of the print, lower density will print faster.</li>
                        <li> Spiralize Outer Countour was cool effect. You can easily make a cup with this. </li>
                        <li> Played with a few different support type, good to see what are the available settings in Cura for support. </li>
