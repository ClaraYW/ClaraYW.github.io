                    My name is Clara! I'm a 3rd-year HCDE master's student. I am a UX designer and researcher. 
                For most of my projects, I work on design for digital products. 
                I want to do more projects on physical products, and design for non-digital things. I take digital fabrication so that I can learn some tools needed to make physical products. 
                I am excited to learn 3D printing and laser cutting (if possible) in this class. 
                I am happy to share my knowledge in design, design tools, basic HTML & CSS with my peers and help wherever I can.
