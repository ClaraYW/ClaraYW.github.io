                <div class="content">
                    <h3> Design & Sketch Ideas </h3>
                    <p>
                        I changed my last week's idea from doing to box lamp to a shell lamp, and make the light bulb like a pearl in the shell. 
                        I also want to add patterns to the shell so that when the light is on, it can be reflected on the wall. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        About the lamp: there were a few features I thought about:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Have a support at the base of the lamp that help to lift it up so the light bulb doesn't touch the plastic bottom directly. </li>
                        <li>Have a connector that connects the top and bottom shell so that when lift the other side it will open like a shell.
                            <ul>
                                <li>User should be able to change the light bulb easily with one side can be open as wide as needed. </li>
                                <li>The connector needs to be removable so that user can easily remove the socket.</li>
                                <li>The connector is strong enough to keep the top and bottom shell together on one side. 
                                    Lifting the other side up should not disconnect the connected side easily. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Have a mini stepper on the top shell and a stick at the bottom shell, so that user can adjust different angle of the shell opening and lock the angle with the stick and stepper. </li>
                        
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>About the connector/clip: Originally, I thought about using a clip that has a handle so user can easily open it up and clip the top and bottom of the shell.
                        Then I was inspired by the zip ties and put down the below requirements for my connector/clip </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The clip needs to be flexible so that it can be easily opened without breaking. </li>
                        <li>Instead of a handle which might ruin the aesthetics of the perfectly oval shapped Lamp, 
                            I decided that it just needs a way for user to open it easily, so if it's a ring shape and it's big enough to fit two fingers to easiy expand it, that works too. </li>
                        <li>The ring cannot be too big that the connection between the shells become loose.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3> Model a right size lamp shell </h3>
                    <p>
                        I downloaded a shell looking mesh from Thingiverse. 
                    </p>
                    <!-- <a class="download" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:179106" download>Smily Minion Original STL</a> -->

                   <p>I measured the height of my socket with the light bulb screwed in to see how big my lamp shell need to be. 
                    Then I adjust the mesh in Rhino to make sure the light bulb can fit in. 
                    I cut a oval shape at the back of the shell to allow extra room for the end of the socket to stick out and be connected to the cable.
                I   The mesh was originally circle shape, I reshaped it to be oval so that it looks more like a shell.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p> The mesh was very big but good. I tried to reduced it size and it went from good mesh to bad mesh. After played with it a few times and tried to fix the reduced size bad mesh.
                        I decided that I will just keep the origianl good mesh. Imported to CURA, and it said it will take 20 hours 40 minutes to print one side.
                        So I adjusted different setting in Cura and played with different speed, and was only able to cut it down to 19 hours. 

                    </p>  

                    <P> My first print of the lamp actually failed as the filament got stucked on the roll and it broke. So for 8 hours the printer was printing with just air. ðŸ˜” </P>

                    <p>After printed the first one, I realize that I might not need to cut hole for the bottom shell as the original hole shold be big enough for the end of the socket.
                    After printed both shell, I used a zip tie to try to see how big the ring needs to be, and used that as reference to make my clips.

                   <p>Challenge: The LED light didn't come through the shell with patterns reflected on the wall as expected. I had to move the lamp to be super close to a wall to see some reflection of the patterns on the shell.
                       My guess is that it's too bright or maybe the light is too scattered?

                   </p>

                        <div class="image-container">

                        </div>

                    </div>

                    <p>To fix the issue with not showing the pattern very well, I decided to try with much smaller LEDs. 
                        I used CPX to try it out, and you can see the patterns are better reflected on the cardboard.</p>

                    <p>The concept of the box is that the top can be removed and it will sit on the base. There is a wall on the base to help keep the top in place once it's on.
                        I modeled a 20mm small one to want to test the concept first. 
                    </p>

                    <p>The issue I ran into is not surprising. The top coulden't fit into the bottom. I will need to make some adjustments on the size in the next round. 
                        To make the inner width of the top square bigger or make the bottom wall smaller.

                    <p>I found a solid heart STL on Thingiverse, and decided to do a test print. Given it's a heart shape, I was trying to see how to best place it on the bed. 
                        For this first attemp, I placed it vertically straignt to minimize the supporting materials. If I place it sideways, I was thinking it will be a mass to try to clean the supports.
                        I also didnt put add addiitonal support, and it got detached from the bed when it's less then half way done. 
                        The heart was been dragging back and forth on the board while the printer continued to print spaghetti ðŸ˜‚. 
                    </p>
                    <p>For the next trial, I will add brim or maybe some support to the base to help it stick better. </p>
