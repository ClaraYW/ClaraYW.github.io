                    <h3> Design & Sketch Ideas </h3>
                    <p>
                        I changed my last week's idea from doing to box lamp to a shell lamp, and make the light bulb like a pearl in the shell. 
                        I also want to add patterns to the shell so that when the light is on, it can be reflected on the wall. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        About the lamp: there were a few features I thought about:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Have a support at the base of the lamp that help to lift it up so the light bulb doesn't touch the plastic bottom directly. </li>
                        <li>Have a connector that connects the top and bottom shell so that when lift the other side it will open like a shell.
                            <ul>
                                <li>User should be able to change the light bulb easily with one side can be open as wide as needed. </li>
                                <li>The connector needs to be removable so that user can easily remove the socket.</li>
                                <li>The connector is strong enough to keep the top and bottom shell together on one side. 
                                    Lifting the other side up should not disconnect the connected side easily. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Have a mini stepper on the top shell and a stick at the bottom shell, so that user can adjust different angle of the shell opening and lock the angle with the stick and stepper. </li>
                        
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>About the connector/clip: Originally, I thought about using a clip that has a handle so user can easily open it up and clip the top and bottom of the shell.
                        Then I was inspired by the zip ties and put down the below requirements for my connector/clip </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The clip needs to be flexible so that it can be easily opened without breaking. </li>
                        <li>Instead of a handle which might ruin the aesthetics of the perfectly oval shapped Lamp, 
                            I decided that it just needs a way for user to open it easily, so if it's a ring shape and it's big enough to fit two fingers to easiy expand it, that works too. </li>
                        <li>The ring cannot be too big that the connection between the shells become loose.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3> Model a right size lamp shell </h3>
                    <p>
                        I downloaded a shell looking mesh from Thingiverse. 
                    </p>
                    <!-- <a class="download" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:179106" download>Smily Minion Original STL</a> -->

                   <p>I measured the height of my socket with the light bulb screwed in to see how big my lamp shell need to be. 
                    Then I adjust the mesh in Rhino to make sure the light bulb can fit in. 
                    I cut a oval shape at the back of the shell to allow extra room for the end of the socket to stick out and be connected to the cable.
                I   The mesh was originally circle shape, I reshaped it to be oval so that it looks more like a shell.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p> The mesh was very big but good. I tried to reduced it size and it went from good mesh to bad mesh. After played with it a few times and tried to fix the reduced size bad mesh.
                        I decided that I will just keep the origianl good mesh. Imported to CURA, and it said it will take 20 hours 40 minutes to print one side.
                        So I adjusted different setting in Cura and played with different speed, and was only able to cut it down to 19 hours. 

                    </p>  

                    <P> My first print of the lamp actually failed as the filament got stucked on the roll and it broke. So for 8 hours the printer was printing with just air. ðŸ˜” </P>

                    <p>After printed the first one, I realize that I might not need to cut hole for the bottom shell as the original hole shold be big enough for the end of the socket.
                    After printed both shell, I used a zip tie to try to see how big the ring needs to be, and used that as reference to make my clips.

                   <p>Challenge: The LED light didn't come through the shell with patterns reflected on the wall as expected. I had to move the lamp to be super close to a wall to see some reflection of the patterns on the shell.
                       My guess is that it's too bright or maybe the light is too scattered?

                   </p>

                        <div class="image-container">

                        </div>

                    </div>

                    <p>To fix the issue with not showing the pattern very well, I decided to try with much smaller LEDs. 
                        I used CPX to try it out, and you can see the patterns are better reflected on the cardboard.</p>

                        <li>BooleanDifference: to separate the original object insteaad and created the parting line in the middle of the heart. </li>

                        <li>DupeEdge to allow selection of the curves on the cutted side of the surface. </li>
                        <li>RibbonOffset: Select curves then ribbonoffset (which I later realize that I might not need this because of my parting line is already all at the same level on the z-axis.) 
                            I also realized the default RibbonOffset is not perfectly following the parting by default. So I used "Add slash" to address it.</li>

                    <p> To make sure the two liquid has equal weight, I used a scale. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Issue: Becasue I intentionally cut two pouring holds in the print mode, the liquid was leaking out. So I turned the two holes facing each other with a pice of paper in between to prevent it from completely sticky together later. </p>
